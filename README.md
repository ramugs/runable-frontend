I have developed an application that allows users to copy and paste components, preview their design, and edit them before saving to the backend.

Tech Stack

- Frontend: Vite, React

- State Management: Zustand

- Form handel : useForm hook

- Routing: TanStack Router

- Caching & Data Fetching: TanStack Query

- API Calls: Axios

- Styling: Tailwind CSS

- Backend: Node.js, Express

User Authentication
Users log in with a username and password. If the provided credentials match an existing account, they can access their saved components. If the username or password is different, a new account will be created.

Functionality
